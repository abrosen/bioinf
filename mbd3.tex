\title{MBD Talk 3 Writeup}
\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	This talk was about the global pandemic of HIV, which currently infects around 35 million people.
	The bible belt is a hot spot in the US.
	
	
	The talk started with a biology heavy background on the mechanisms of HIV infection.
	In particular was how HIV replication is impacted by dozens of miRNA, particular in regards to transcription \cite{klase2012micrornas}.
	The other relevant bit was how HIV exploits the exosome pathway \cite{nguyen2003evidence}.  
	If anything is blocked in this pathway, then HIV can't replicate.
