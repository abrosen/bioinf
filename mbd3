HIV-1: subversive strategies in transmission and pathogenisis

35 million infected currently.
deaths caused by opportunistic infections
global pandemic, but clustered in sub-saharan Africa
Affects primarily people of color, large disparity. 
Bible belt is the hot-spot for HIV  2013 CDC rates of diagonises of HIV infections

Mechanisms
When HIV infection occurs, hundred of genes are modulated, some by cellular/host response, but also mby the virus
microRNA -HIV replication isimpacted by dozens of miRNA, most affect transcription  Klase Z et al 2012

Exosomes- HIV exploits this pathway to  form HIV particles
If you can block anything in this pathway, you stop HIV

Activation of Endogenous Retroviruses occurs during HIV infection  
Human Endogenous Retroviruses  (HERVS) can cause pathogenesis in humans

HIV is a retrovirus
attaches to the cell, has two receptors
retro -Central dogma in reverse
reverse transcription
copied into genome, why infection is infection for life.

HIV is fairly short but works with greater complexity
Hypothesis:  HIV aquires host protiens from infected cless. Hildreth and Orentas Involement of a leukocyte adhesion
Guo and Hildereth 1995 HIV 

So how does HIV aquire protiens
Lipid rafts are the sites for HIV budding
Turned out to be the case for a lot of viruses.

Modulaing cholesterol prevents infection
removing cholesterol from membran of affected cell blocks release of infectious particles.  Particles are still emitted, but 

20HpBCD as a vaginal microbicide
Would kill HIV cells on contact
20HpBCD as HIV Theraputic agent

Subversion of Immune Recognition
Is HIV biology linked to Exosome biogolgy

Exosomes about same size as HIV
Produced and taken up by many cell types
Exosomes are a big deal in medicine now, being looked at for application to cancer

Exosomes can be used to activate T-cells (Hwang et al) T cells exposed to exosomes from  immature  100:6670-6675

Trojan Exosome Hypothesis:
bc: HIV  exploits the exosome pathway
HIV acts like an exosome
preparations of HIV are always contaminated by exosomes
Long story short it can idenify and kill the T-Cells hunting for it
Exosomes predict vaccines will help the virus.
