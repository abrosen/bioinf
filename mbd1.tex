	\maketitle
	This talk was about Glioma-initiating cells (GIC).
	Glioblastoma, or GBM, is the most prevalent form of brain tumors and, unfortunately, also the most lethal.
	Researchers have been interested in GIC's, which have some characteristics extremely similar to stem-cells \cite{wang2014mir}, but also because they are responsible for resistance to chemotherapy \cite{bao2006glioma}.
	
	
	Wang et al.\ \cite{wang2014mir} found that miR-33a promotes GIC growth and renewal.
	In 107 examined patient with GBM, patients with low levels of miR-33a had a longer survival.
	This is in comparison to the patient population with high levels of miR-33a, which had a very sharp drop-off in survival.
	Inhibiting miR-33a in rats slowed the self-renewal process and the tumor progression stage of GIC's 
	The mechanisms behind this are two targets of miR-33a: PDE8A and UVRAG, which had a reverse correlation with miR-33a level.
	Introducing a compound to inhibit the production of miR-33a look to be a promising treatment, but the blood-brain barrier would have to somehow be overcome for delivery.
